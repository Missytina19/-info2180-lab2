        <p>This is my very first blog post for INFO2180. I started this journey excited to learn the foundations of web development and to see how HTML and CSS come together to create a real webpage. Working through this lab has shown me how much design and structure matter in presenting content online.</p>
        <p>I’m enjoying experimenting with layouts, colors, and typography to make the page look polished. My goal is to continue improving these skills so I can eventually design professional, user-friendly websites that anyone can navigate easily.</p>

        <h2>Building Better UI</h2>

        <p>As I learn more about web development, I’ve realized that creating a good user interface is more than just choosing nice colors. It’s about making sure that everything on the page is easy to find and use. When the layout feels natural, users spend more time exploring the content.</p>
        <p>Practicing with HTML and CSS has helped me understand the importance of spacing, alignment, and consistency. With every project I build, I get closer to creating designs that balance both beauty and functionality. This motivates me to keep pushing forward.</p>
